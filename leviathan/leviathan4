We quickly see with the above ouput some string comparaisons.
We try both "h0no33", "kakaka" but they seem to just be some type of legwork

then see see strcmp("snlprintf\n", "snlprintf\n")  

We know that is what we want

We drop into a shell                                            

puts("[You've got shell]!"[You've got shell]!
)                                                       = 20
geteuid()                                                                         = 12003
geteuid()                                                                         = 12003
setreuid(12003, 12003)                                                            = 0
system("/bin/sh"$ cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan4
cat: /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan4: Permission denied
$ whoami
leviathan3

but somehow attempts to cat the password wont work.

exit the environment and boom.
